# grAIde

AI-powered grading assistant for teachers.

## About

grAIde combines **grading** with **AI** to help teachers save time and provide better feedback to students. Initially focused on mathematics education for Romanian middle school (grades 5-8), grAIde aims to automate repetitive grading tasks while keeping teachers in control.

### Key Features (Planned)
