## Questions & Answers

### Q1: What is the ONE biggest pain point to solve first?
**Category**: Scope & Priorities
**Status**: ✅ Answered
**Answer**:

**Primary Pain Point: SPEED**

The grading volume is significant:
- 60-90 papers per weekend
- 3-5 minutes per paper
- Total: 4-6 hours of non-stop grading

**Related Pain Points:**
1. **Fatigue-induced mistakes**: Long grading sessions lead to errors
2. **No tracking system**: Grades and mistakes are not systematically recorded, requiring revisiting
3. **Pattern analysis needed**:
   - Same mistakes across multiple students (class-wide patterns)
   - Similar mistakes by individual students over time (student-specific patterns)
4. **Physical paper management**: Carrying 100+ papers between home and classroom
5. **Legibility issues**: Reading messy handwriting slows down the process

**Implication for MVP**:
The solution must prioritize reducing grading time while automatically tracking grades and extracting mistake patterns. Digital paper management (via scanning/photos) would also eliminate the physical burden.
