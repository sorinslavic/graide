## Questions & Answers

### Q1: What is the ONE biggest pain point to solve first?
**Category**: Scope & Priorities
**Status**: ✅ Answered
**Answer**:

**Primary Pain Point: SPEED**

The grading volume is significant:
- 60-90 papers per weekend
- 3-5 minutes per paper
- Total: 4-6 hours of non-stop grading

**Related Pain Points:**
1. **Fatigue-induced mistakes**: Long grading sessions lead to errors
2. **No tracking system**: Grades and mistakes are not systematically recorded, requiring revisiting
3. **Pattern analysis needed**:
   - Same mistakes across multiple students (class-wide patterns)
   - Similar mistakes by individual students over time (student-specific patterns)
4. **Physical paper management**: Carrying 100+ papers between home and classroom
5. **Legibility issues**: Reading messy handwriting slows down the process

**Implication for MVP**:
The solution must prioritize reducing grading time while automatically tracking grades and extracting mistake patterns. Digital paper management (via scanning/photos) would also eliminate the physical burden.

### Q2: How does your wife currently grade tests?
**Category**: Current Workflow
**Status**: ✅ Answered
**Answer**:

**Current Manual Process:**

**Test Format:**
- Physical A4 papers (stack of 60-90)
- Two question types:
  1. Simple answer entry directly on test page
  2. Multi-step problems requiring additional pages showing computation/work

**Step-by-Step Grading Workflow:**
1. Pick up each paper from stack
2. Identify student name on paper
3. Review each problem and student's answer
4. Circle answers in red (incorrect) or green (correct)
5. Assign points for each question
6. Manually add up all points to calculate total score
7. While grading, identify and mark specific mistakes:
   - Incorrect formulas
   - Basic math operation errors (addition, subtraction, etc.)
   - Typos that led to wrong results
   - Circle and annotate the error

**Grade Recording:**
- Online gradebook exists but is **optional/not always used**
- **Primary requirement**: Must be able to verbally tell each student their grade
- **Critical requirement**: Must remember what mistakes each student made to guide them toward understanding

**Key Insight:**
The goal isn't just recording grades - it's retaining knowledge of each student's specific errors to provide individualized guidance and reteaching. This mental load is significant across 60-90 students per test.
