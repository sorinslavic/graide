# grAIde - Project Overview

## Vision
grAIde is an AI-powered grading assistant designed to help teachers (initially focused on math teachers) save time and provide better feedback to students.

The name combines:
- **Grade** - the core function of evaluating student work
- **AI** - artificial intelligence assistance
- Pronounced like "grayed"

## Problem Statement
Teachers spend countless hours grading tests and assignments. This time-consuming process:
- Takes away from lesson planning and student interaction
- Can be repetitive and tedious
- Often lacks personalized feedback due to time constraints
- May have inconsistencies in grading

## Solution
grAIde aims to:
1. **Automate** repetitive grading tasks
2. **Assist** in providing personalized, constructive feedback
3. **Analyze** patterns in student performance
4. **Save time** for teachers to focus on teaching

## Target Users
- **Primary**: Math teachers (K-12)
- **Future**: Teachers across all subjects

## Initial Use Case
Built with input from a real math teacher to solve real classroom challenges.

## Key Principles
1. **Teacher-centric**: Built for teachers, by understanding their workflow
2. **Privacy-first**: Student data security is paramount
3. **AI-augmented, not AI-replaced**: Teachers remain in control
4. **Simple to use**: Minimal learning curve
5. **Cost-effective**: Accessible pricing for individual teachers and schools

## Success Metrics (To Be Defined)
- Time saved per grading session
- Quality of AI-generated feedback
- Teacher satisfaction
- Student performance improvement

## Project Status
**Phase**: Planning & Design
